## Create an Example Package in R 

Package: fars
GitHub:  https://github.com/dmkosmidis/fars1/tree/main

## Data Source

The functions will be using data from the US National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration's [Fatality Analysis Reporting 
System](https://www.nhtsa.gov/research-data/fatality-analysis-reporting-system-fars),
which is a nationwide census providing the American public yearly data regarding
fatal injuries suffered in motor vehicle traffic crashes.

## Review Criteria

For this assignment you'll submit a link to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dmkosmidis/fars1) which contains
your package. This assessment will ask reviewers the following questions:

* Does this package contain the correct [R file(s) under the R/ directory](https://github.com/dmkosmidis/fars1/tree/main/R)?   
* Does this package contain a 
[man/](https://github.com/dmkosmidis/fars1/tree/main/man) with directory
corresponding documentation files?
* Does this package contain a 
[vignette](https://github.com/dmkosmidis/fars1/tree/main/vignettes/fars.Rmd) 
which provides a meaningful description of the package and how it should be 
used?
* Does this package have at least one test included in the [tests/](https://github.com/dmkosmidis/fars1/tree/main/tests/testthat) directory?
